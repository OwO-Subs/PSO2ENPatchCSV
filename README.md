Any CSV files located in [Files] are still to be translated, while the CSV files in other folders are at least partly translated.

### Don't know Japanese but still want to contribute?
If you don't understand Japanese, but still want to help out, you can look over the translated lines and make sure all grammar and spelling is correct. (US English, please!)

### Notice
* If you want to translate a file that's in the "/Files/" directory then you **MUST** [move the file into another directory](https://github.com/blog/1436-moving-and-renaming-files-on-github) before you translate it. The /Files/ directory **MUST** only contain untranslated files.
* You can find stuff to translate by using the GLaDOS bot in the #translations-public room on the **[PSO2 Discord Server]**. Usage will be in the pinned messages.

* Maintain the triple quotes and only edit the text inside the quotes.
* Be sure to take a look at the **[Wiki]** page for guides and reminders before sending us your translations.
* You may create new issues to discuss the translations with other translators. Please note that issues not related to translation may be deleted without notice.
